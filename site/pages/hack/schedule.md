<h3>Where can I hack?</h3>
<p><strong>Davis 101</strong> can be used for hacking throughout the event.</p>

<h3>Oh no! I can't stay for the whole time because of another event!</h3>
<p>We understand that other events are also happening in a subset of Hack Nights's schedule. You're more than welcome to return to the event, but keep in mind that project submissions end at 7:00pm and you will need to be back in time for project demos.</p>
